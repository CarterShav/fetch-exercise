# Project Functionality:
Read in data from a webpage JSON file, display the data to the user in a clean way such that they can see all the items in a specific order.

# Technical Features:
ViewModel handles the functionality for the UI in a safe way such that operations to retrieve and sort data can be done not on the main thread. A RecyclerView takes in all the data and allows for enough data to be shown to fit on the screen while being able to scroll to other data, saving space to not show all the data at once.

# Usability:
Clone the [repo](https://github.com/CarterShav/fetch-exercise/tree/main).

Create or use an Android device with API Level 34.

Run application on the android device to get the opening screen which contains all relevant pieces.
